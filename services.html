                        And when blood pressure medications are prescribed by doctors and used by the patient(s) instead of healing, the medications can induce other health challenges in the body).<br>
                        A lot of people now exhibit symptoms that mimic schizophrenia, other disorders and withdrawal symptoms because psychological factors were not ruled out when they visited the hospital with health complaints.
                        Therefore, they were wrongly diagnosed and treated.
