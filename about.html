                    <p class="">
                        It's a delight to have you here!<br>
                        Belwet Mind Clinic is an organization that is established based on our passionate love for you. A dream of 2016 came to manifest in 2022.
                        It is so disheartening that a lot of people need therapy but do not know because mental health awareness in Nigeria is still poor. <br>
                        That is why an average Nigerian sees an individual who wants to consult a mental health therapist as being mad or almost mad. 
                        The next offensive slang you hear is yaba left or Sako Sako.<br>Also, a lot of people fear being stigmatized and guilt-tripped. 
                        Nigeria is a very religious Nation and an average Nigerian is always ready to cast the first stone.<br>
                        At Belwet Mind Clinic, we don't just provide therapy in a soothing atmosphere, 
                        we are also determined to be an exceptional mental health advocate by creating a series of articles, videos, seminars and lectures on mental health awareness.<br>
                        We have a new and growing YouTube channel just for you.<br>
                        Belwet mind clinic is built on these four principles-enlighten, communicate, connect and explore.
                        We provide services to children, teens, young adults, old adults, couples, groups, organizations and communities.<br>
                        You can access our exceptional online services from the comfort of your device 24/7. 
                        Temporarily, physical face-to-face services are provided in Kaduna and Abuja, Nigeria.

                    <h3 class="">OUR SERVICE APPROACH</h3>
                    <p class="">
                        a.Evidence Focused<br>
                        We are attentive to our client's improvement and feedback.
                        <br><br>
                        b.Convenience<br>
                        Almost everything ranging from shopping to business is conveniently delivered these days. Why not therapy, coaching, training, and other mental health services?
                        <br><br>
                        c. Personalized Profiling<br>
                        We understand that therapy without clinical and psychological assessment is short-lived. Therefore, in between mind clinics, a psychological assessment precedes our services.
                        <br><br> 
                        d. Relaxing and Friendly<br>
                        We believe that clients live to regret and not heal when the service offered is rigid and guilt-trapped. Being too professional without a touch of friendliness is not therapy. We believe everyone deserves to be heard and to also live their best life. There is a plan for everyone.
                        <br><br>
                        e. Team Work<br>
                        Individually, we do not know and teamwork makes a dream work. So each team member sticks to their areas of specialization.
